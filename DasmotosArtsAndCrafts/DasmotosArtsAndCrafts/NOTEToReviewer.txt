Hey could you give me pointers as to how to make the white 'text boxes' resizeable with the size of the window and also how to make
the title scale with the size of the window (e.g. on a phone?)

Also learning how to use different fonts (e.g. Oxygen) and how I could make the title Oxygen typeface.

Also giving the webpage some interactive design like how to make a title shift color (either with CSS animation or JS)
Also like a home button that is a little house, a facebook [f], etc on the title banner

I HAVE NO IDEA if CodeAcademy is going to teach me how to do these things
